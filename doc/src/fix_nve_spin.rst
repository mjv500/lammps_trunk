Description
"""""""""""

Perform a symplectic integration for the spin or spin-lattice system.

The *lattice* keyword defines if the spins are integrated on a lattice
of fixed atoms (lattice = frozen), or if atoms are moving
(lattice = moving).
The first case corresponds to a spin dynamics calculation, and
the second to a spin-lattice calculation.
By default a spin-lattice integration is performed (lattice = moving).

The *nve/spin* fix applies a Suzuki-Trotter decomposition to
the equations of motion of the spin lattice system, following the scheme:

.. image:: JPG/fix_integration_spin_stdecomposition.jpg
   :align: center

according to the implementation reported in :ref:`(Omelyan) <Omelyan1>`.

A sectoring method enables this scheme for parallel calculations.
The implementation of this sectoring algorithm is reported
in :ref:`(Tranchida) <Tranchida1>`.
Each processor sub-domain is cut in two halves (sectors) along every
direction in which the simulation box is divided between several
processors (see the :doc:`processors <processors>` command), giving 2,
4, or 8 sectors.  Spins in sectors with the same index on different
processors do not interact and are updated at the same time.  This
requires the sub-domain of each processor to be at least twice as wide
as the largest magnetic pair cutoff plus the :doc:`neighbor skin
distance <neighbor>` in each of these directions.  The skin is needed
because atoms can move by up to half the skin distance between two
neighbor list builds.  There is no size requirement in directions that
are not divided between processors, so that, e.g., thin films can be run
in parallel with a processor grid like "processors \* \* 1".  With
:doc:`comm_style tiled <comm_style>`, all directions are cut in two.

.. versionchanged:: TBD

Sectors are only created in directions divided between processors
(before, 2x2x2 sectors were always required), the size requirement
includes the neighbor skin, and it is checked again whenever the
sub-domains change.

The sequential update of the spins described above is the default
(*integrator sequential*).  Since the spins of one sector have to be
updated before those of the next one, the spin update requires about 30
exchanges of data between processors per timestep, which limits the
parallel efficiency when there are few atoms per processor.

.. versionadded:: TBD

   *integrator midpoint*, *iterations*, and *tol* keywords

With *integrator midpoint*, each of the two spin updates per timestep
(over half a timestep, :math:`h = \Delta t/2`) is done for all spins at
once with the implicit midpoint rule

.. math::

   \vec{s}_i(t+h) = \vec{s}_i(t) + h \, \vec{\omega}_i(\vec{m}) \times \vec{m}_i,
   \qquad \vec{m} = \frac{\vec{s}(t) + \vec{s}(t+h)}{2}

where :math:`\vec{\omega}_i(\vec{m})` is the magnetic field (precession
vector) acting on spin *i*, computed from the midpoint values of all
spins.  The new spin is obtained as a rotation of the old one, so that
the length of each spin is preserved exactly.  The equation is solved by
iteration: each iteration computes the fields of all spins from the
current estimate of the midpoints and updates all spins.  The *iterations*
keyword sets the number of iterations (field evaluations), and the *tol*
keyword optionally stops the iterations earlier once no spin component
changes by more than *tol* (this requires an extra global sum per
iteration).  If the iterations do not converge to *tol*, a warning is
printed.  For timesteps of about 0.1 fs in bcc iron, each iteration
changes the spins about two orders of magnitude less than the previous
one, so that the default of 4 iterations solves the equation to nearly
round-off.  The change of the spins in the last iteration can be
monitored (see below) to check this for other systems and timesteps.

When the equation is solved exactly, the implicit midpoint rule conserves
the magnetic energy for interactions that are quadratic in the spins
(e.g., exchange, DMI, anisotropy, Zeeman) and the total magnetization for
isotropic exchange :ref:`(Hairer) <Hairer1>`.  Like the sequential update,
it is second order in the timestep, and time-reversible when solved
exactly.  It needs more field evaluations per timestep than the
sequential update (8 instead of 4 with the default settings), but only
one exchange of data between processors per iteration, and no sectors:
there is no restriction on the size of the processor sub-domains, any
processor grid or
:doc:`comm_style tiled <comm_style>` can be used, and the result does
not depend on the number of processors (except for round-off).  This
can make it faster than the sequential update when running with few atoms
per processor.

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

No information about this fix is written to :doc:`binary restart files
<restart>`.  None of the :doc:`fix_modify <fix_modify>` options are
relevant to this fix.

With *integrator midpoint*, this fix computes a global vector of length
2, which can be accessed by various :doc:`output commands
<Howto_output>`.  The first element is the number of field evaluations
per spin during the last timestep (for both spin updates), the second
element is the largest change of a spin component in the last iteration.
These values are "intensive".  No global or per-atom quantities are
stored by this fix with *integrator sequential*.

No parameter of this fix can be used with the *start/stop* keywords of
the :doc:`run <run>` command.  This fix is not invoked during
:doc:`energy minimization <minimize>`.

----------

Restrictions
""""""""""""

This fix style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the SPIN
package.  See the :doc:`Build package <Build_package>` page for more
info.

To use the spin algorithm, it is necessary to define a map with
the atom_modify command. Typically, by adding the command:

.. code-block:: LAMMPS

   atom_modify map array

before you create the simulation box. Note that the keyword "hash"
instead of "array" is also valid.

When running on multiple processors with a moving lattice, the sectoring
algorithm relies on atoms moving less than half the neighbor skin
distance between two neighbor list builds.  This is only guaranteed
with the settings

.. code-block:: LAMMPS

   neigh_modify every 1 delay 0 check yes once no

With other settings (e.g. *every* > 1, *delay* > 0, or *once* yes), a
warning is printed, and another one if atoms did move too far during the
run (i.e. if there are "dangerous builds"), since then spins of atoms on
different processors may have been updated in the wrong order.  This
does not apply to *integrator midpoint*.

*Integrator midpoint* cannot be used with :doc:`fix langevin/spin
<fix_langevin_spin>` at a non-zero temperature yet (transverse damping
is supported).
